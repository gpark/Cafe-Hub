  Scenario: View my own schedule
    When I am on the user dashboard
    Then I should see "MMF" in the time slot for "08:00 AM - 09:00 AM" on "Monday"
    And I should see "MMF" in the time slot for "08:00 AM - 09:00 AM" on "Wednesday"

  Scenario: View other's schedule
    When I am on James' assigned schedule page
    Then I should see "MMF" in the time slot for "03:00 PM - 04:00 PM" on "Tuesday"
    And I should see "MMF" in the time slot for "04:00 PM - 05:00 PM" on "Tuesday"
